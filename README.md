# Online-Grading-System


This Grading System is a web-based system and it’s main goal is to allow Professor/Teachers to manage class grades and access the list of students in a school. The student can easily view their grades online through their Student ID. With this, they will be able to identify what subjects they excelled or failed. Students will no longer visit the registrar’s office to submit and request for grades because this system will provide the grades and records accurately. This also calculates the final grades of every student at the end of the semester.
